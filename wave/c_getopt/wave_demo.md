% The 1D wave equation (C edition)

This is another serial implementation of the wave stepper code.
The purpose is to give some tips about how to organize a time-stepper
code like this (e.g. using a limited history buffer for time steps),
and also to show off how the argument processing works.

This is also an opportunity for me to show of my
[`ldoc`](https://github.com/dbindel/ldoc) documentation generator.

## Argument processing

The [`getopt`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getopt)
command is a parser for Unix-style command line flags.
It's a bit clunky and awkward, but still worth knowing about.
Even a code as simple as the 1D wave equation solver has several
possible parameters: the number of grid points, the wave speed,
the time step, the number of time steps, and the name of the output
file, in this case.

    int parse_args(int argc, char** argv,
                   int* n, double* c, double* dt, int* nsteps, char** ofname)
    {
        int opt;
        int err_flag = 0;
        const char* help_string =
            "Usage: wave_demo [-h] [-n nmesh] [-c speed] [-t dt] [-s nsteps] [-o fname]\n"
            "\n"
            "  h: Print this message\n"
            "  n: Set the mesh size (default %d)\n"
            "  c: Set the speed of sound (default %g)\n"
            "  t: Set the time step (default %g)\n"
            "  s: Set the number of steps (default %d)\n"
            "  o: Output file name (default none)\n";
    
        while ((opt = getopt(argc, argv, "hn:c:t:s:o:")) != -1) {
            switch (opt) {
                case 'h':
                    fprintf(stderr, help_string, *n, *c, *dt, *nsteps, *ofname);
                    err_flag = 1;
                    break;
                case 'n':
                    *n = atoi(optarg);
                    if (*n < 3) {
                        fprintf(stderr, "Error: Need at least three mesh points\n");
                        err_flag = -1;
                    }
                    break;
                case 'c':
                    *c = atof(optarg);
                    break;
                case 't':
                    if (*dt <= 0.0) {
                        fprintf(stderr, "Error: Time step must be positive\n");
                        err_flag = 1;
                    }
                    *dt = atof(optarg);
                    break;
                case 's':
                    *nsteps = atoi(optarg);
                    break;
                case 'o':
                    *ofname = strdup(optarg);
                    break;
                case '?':
                    fprintf(stderr, "Unknown option\n");
                    err_flag = -1;
                    break;
            }
        }
        return err_flag;
    }
    
## The time stepper

The `time_step` command takes one time step of a standard finite
difference solver for the wave equation
$$
  u_{tt} = c^2 u_{xx}
$$
on a 1D domain with provided Dirichlet data.  We approximate
both second derivatives by finite differences, i.e.
$$
  u_{tt}(x,t) \approx
    \frac{u(x,t-\Delta t) - 2 u(x,t) + u(x,t+\Delta t)}{(\Delta t)^2}
$$
and similarly for the second derivative in space.  Plugging this
into the wave equation and rearranging terms gives us the update
formula
$$
  u(x, t + \Delta t) =
    2 u(x,t) - u(x,t-\Delta t) +
    \left( c \frac{\Delta t}{\Delta x} \right)^2
    \left( u(x+\Delta x, t) - 2 u(x,t) + u(x-\Delta x, t) \right)
$$
We let `u0[i]` and `u1[i]` denote the values of $u(x_i,t-\Delta t)$ and
$u(x_i, t)$ for a mesh of points $x_i$ with spacing $\Delta x$,
and write to the output `u2` which contains $u(x, t + \Delta t)$.

The wave equation requires boundary conditions as well as initial
data, and this time stepper does not explicitly handle boundary conditions.
Instead, the boundary conditions need to be handled by a separate routine
that updates a layer of `b` "ghost cells" at each end of the computational
mesh.  This can be done by filling in fixed values (for Dirichlet boundary
conditions), copying endpoint values (for homogeneous Neumann conditions),
or transferring data from a neighboring processor (for the case where the
time stepper is being used inside of another code).

    void time_step(int n,             // Total number of grid points
                   int b,             // Number of boundary cells at each end
                   const double* restrict u0,  // Data two time steps ago
                   const double* restrict u1,  // Data one time step ago
                   double* restrict u2,        // Data to be computed
                   double c,          // Wave speed
                   double dx,         // Spatial step size
                   double dt)         // Time step size
    {
        double C = c*(dt/dx);
        double C2 = C*C;
        for (int i = b; i < n-b; ++i)
            u2[i] = 2*u1[i]-u0[i] + C2*(u1[i-1]-2*u1[i]+u1[i+1]);
    }
    
Of course, we generally don't want to take exactly one time step:
we want to take many time steps.  We only need to keep three
consecutive time steps.  We indicate the most recent completed step
with `i0`; the step before is at `i0-1` (mod 3) and the step to be
computed is at `i0+1` (mod 3).  We'll return the index (mod 3)
of the last time step computed.

    int time_steps(int n, int b, double* us, int i0, int nsteps,
                   double c, double dx, double dt)
    {
        for (int j = 0; j < nsteps; ++j) {
            double* u0 = us + ((i0+2+j)%3)*n;
            double* u1 = us + ((i0+0+j)%3)*n;
            double* u2 = us + ((i0+1+j)%3)*n;
            time_step(n, 1, u0, u1, u2, c, dx, dt);
        }
        return (i0+nsteps)%3;
    }
    
## Initial conditions

If we want a general purpose code, it often makes sense to separate
out the initial conditions from everything else.  Certainly you
want to make it easy to swap out one set of initial conditions for
another.

    void initial_conditions(int n, double* u0, double* u1,
                            double c, double dx, double dt)
    {
        for (int i = 1; i < n-1; ++i) {
            double x = i*dx;
            u0[i] = exp(-25*(x-0.5)*(x-0.5));
            u1[i] = exp(-25*(x-0.5-c*dt)*(x-0.5-c*dt));
        }
    }
    
## Printing the state

We will use a simple text file format for the simulation state.
That makes it easier to read into a viewer like the Python script
that we wrote for the Python version of this code.  A binary format
(or a compressed binary format) might be worth considering if we are
planning to output more data.  One might also consider downsampling
the output (e.g. printing only every mth mesh point) if the purpose
of the output is visualization rather than detailed diagnosis
or restarting of a simulation.

    void print_mesh(FILE* fp, int n, double* u)
    {
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
            fprintf(fp, "%g\n", u[i]);
    }
    
    
## The `main` event

    int main(int argc, char** argv)
    {
        // Set defaults and parse arguments
        int n = 1000;
        double c = 1.0;
        double dt = 5e-4;
        int nsteps = 3600;
        char* fname = NULL;
        int flag = parse_args(argc, argv, &n, &c, &dt, &nsteps, &fname);
        if (flag != 0)
            return flag;
    
        // Compute space step and check CFL
        double dx = 1.0/(n-1);
        double C = c*dt/dx;
        if (C >= 1.0) {
            printf("CFL constant is %g (should be < 1 for stability)\n", C);
            return -1;
        }
    
        // Setting up the storage space for the time steps
        double* us = (double*) malloc(3 * n * sizeof(double));
        memset(us, 0, 3 * n * sizeof(double));
    
        // Initialize the problem and run the time stepper
        initial_conditions(n, us+0*n, us+1*n, c, dx, dt);
        int last_idx = time_steps(n, 1, us, 1, nsteps, c, dx, dt);
    
        // Write the final output
        if (fname) {
            FILE* fp = fopen(fname, "w");
            print_mesh(fp, n, us+n*last_idx);
            fclose(fp);
        }
    
        // Clean up and return
        free(us);
        return 0;
    }
