# 1D Waves in C and Python

This example uses [Cython and Numpy
arrays](http://scipy-lectures.org/advanced/interfacing_with_c/interfacing_with_c.html#id10)
to interface a C time-stepper with a Python code used for high-level
logic and visualization.  This is not the only way to manage this type
of visualization, but is a nice illustration of how we can glue
together code in different languages in useful ways.
